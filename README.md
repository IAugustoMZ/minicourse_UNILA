# Data Science in Predictive Maintenance Minicourse

This repo consists on the reference code and solution developed along with the student's of the Latin-American Integration University as part of the minicourse concerning an example of the application of Data Science in Chemical and Process Engineering.

## ðŸ‘” **Business Problem Understandment**

<hr>

The problem faced is the the maintenance costs must be reduced due to the chemical market becoming more challenging.

Therefore, a strategic way to reduce cost is to have a predictive approach to tell the engineering team when is best to stop the equipments and make the necessary repairs, before it presents a failure. The actual maintenance is done in a fixed frequency, which can be too early or too late.

By building a data driven model, one could use it as a support to check if the plant has a high chance of having a failure or how many cycles the plant has left before the failure. This could leverage the decicion-making process and reduce costs of unexpected stops.

## âœ… **Data Problem Definition**

<hr>

Having the necessary data for the assets, which consists in the measurements of several sensors, there are two data problems that can be defined:

- a **regression** problem to predict how many cycles the plant has left before the failure
- a **classification** problem to estimate the probability of the plant to have a failure after 20 cycles of operation
